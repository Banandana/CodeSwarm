# CodeSwarm Test Summary

## Test Date
2025-10-06

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Cleanup ✅
- Removed 15 irrelevant documentation files
- Updated README.md to reflect experimental status
- Removed all "production ready" claims
- Committed and pushed changes

### 2. Test Execution

#### Test: Hello World (Simplest Possible)
**Proposal**: Create a Node.js program that prints "Hello, World!"
**Budget**: $75.00
**Timeout**: 2 minutes

**Result**: ❌ HUNG - Timed out after 2 minutes

**What Worked**:
- ✅ CLI started successfully
- ✅ Backup phase completed
- ✅ Analysis phase completed
- ✅ Task decomposition worked: Created 3 tasks
  - task-001: Create package.json
  - task-002: Implement Hello World program
  - task-003: Create README documentation
- ✅ Initial checkpoint saved
- ✅ Budget tracking working: $0.019 spent on analysis
- ✅ Execution phase started
- ✅ Task assignment displayed (task-001 → backend agent)

**What Failed**:
- ❌ System hangs after assigning task-001 to backend agent
- ❌ Task never completes or fails
- ❌ No response from agent
- ❌ No timeout triggers (despite timeout fixes applied)

## Critical Issue Identified

**Problem**: Agent message routing or execution is broken

**Evidence**:
1. Task displayed as "⚙️ task-001 | Agent: backend | Priority: MEDIUM"
2. No progress after that point
3. No error messages
4. No timeout after 3 minutes (base agent timeout)
5. No timeout after 5 minutes (coordinator timeout)

**Possible Root Causes**:
1. Agent not receiving task assignment message
2. Agent receiving task but not executing
3. Agent executing but not responding
4. Communication hub not routing messages
5. Message event listeners not wired up
6. Agent initialization not completing

## Budget Impact

**Total Spent**: $0.019 (analysis only)
**Remaining**: $74.98
**Cost Per Hang**: ~$0.02 per attempt

## Recommendations

### Immediate Investigation Needed:
1. **Check agent initialization** - Are agents being created and initialized?
2. **Check message routing** - Is communication hub routing TASK_ASSIGN messages?
3. **Check event wiring** - Are coordinator → agent event listeners working?
4. **Check backend agent** - Is executeTask() method being called?
5. **Add debug logging** - Need detailed logs in:
   - CoordinatorAgent.assignTask()
   - CommunicationHub.routeMessage()
   - BaseAgent.handleTaskAssignment()
   - BackendAgent.executeTask()

### Testing Strategy:
1. Do NOT run full tests until agent execution is fixed
2. Add extensive console.log debugging to trace message flow
3. Test with even simpler proposal (single task)
4. Check if issue is backend-specific or affects all agents

### Cost Management:
- Each test attempt costs ~$0.02 for analysis
- 50 test attempts = $1.00
- Current budget allows ~3,700 test attempts
- However, hung process wastes time even though it doesn't consume much budget

## Files for Investigation

### Core Message Flow:
1. `src/agents/coordinator-agent.js` - Task assignment
2. `src/core/communication/hub.js` - Message routing
3. `src/agents/base-agent.js` - Task handling
4. `src/agents/backend-agent.js` - Backend execution
5. `src/app.js` - Component initialization and wiring

### Checkpoint Data:
- Location: `./hello-test/.codeswarm/.codeswarm/history/checkpoint_1759794979753.json`
- Shows perfect task decomposition
- Shows no agents array (possibly an issue?)

## Status

**Overall**: System is NOT functional for code generation

**Components**:
- ✅ CLI Interface
- ✅ Proposal parsing
- ✅ Task decomposition
- ✅ Budget tracking
- ✅ Checkpoint creation
- ❌ **Agent message routing** (BROKEN)
- ❌ **Task execution** (BLOCKED by routing)

## Next Steps

1. Add debug logging to message flow
2. Investigate agent initialization
3. Test message routing in isolation
4. Fix root cause
5. Re-test with hello world
