CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - BUDGET MANAGER AND LOCKING SYSTEMS
================================================================================

All 6 critical issues (B1-B6) have been successfully fixed.

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF FIXES
================================================================================

✅ B1: Budget Race Condition (manager.js)
   - Added mutex for atomic validate-and-reserve operations
   - Prevents concurrent budget overruns
   - Lines added: 69-95, 108-110, 205-207

✅ B2: Budget Untracked Operations (manager.js)
   - Now rejects untracked operations with explicit error
   - Forces validation before recording usage
   - Lines modified: 258-272

✅ B3: Reserved Budget Not Released (manager.js)
   - Added releaseReservation() method
   - Releases budget when operations fail
   - Lines added: 211-248

✅ B4: Circuit Breaker Records Success Too Early (manager.js)
   - Removed recordSuccess() from validateOperation()
   - Moved to recordUsage() after operation completes
   - Lines removed: 154 | Lines added: 301-303

✅ B5: Circuit Breaker State Race (circuit-breaker.js)
   - Added mutex for state transitions
   - Serializes recordSuccess() and recordFailure()
   - Made both methods async
   - Lines added: 18-38, 67-127

✅ B6: Lock Leak on Timeout (distributed-lock.js)
   - Added cancellation tracking to prevent lock leaks
   - Mark as cancelled before removal from queue
   - Check cancellation before granting lock
   - Lines added: 72-73, 93, 227-231, 256-272

FILES MODIFIED
================================================================================

1. src/core/budget/manager.js
   - 88 lines changed (58 additions, 30 deletions)
   - Added: _acquireMutex(), releaseReservation()
   - Modified: validateOperation(), recordUsage()

2. src/core/budget/circuit-breaker.js
   - 76 lines changed (67 additions, 9 deletions)
   - Added: _acquireStateMutex()
   - Modified: recordSuccess(), recordFailure(), canExecute()

3. src/core/locking/distributed-lock.js
   - 38 lines changed (35 additions, 3 deletions)
   - Added: _markAsCancelled()
   - Modified: acquireLock(), _processQueue()

================================================================================
BREAKING CHANGES
================================================================================

⚠️  B2: recordUsage() now throws error for untracked operations
    Migration: Call validateOperation() before recordUsage()

⚠️  B3: Must call releaseReservation() in error handlers
    Migration: Add try/catch with releaseReservation() on error

⚠️  B5: recordSuccess() and recordFailure() are now async
    Migration: Use await when calling these methods
