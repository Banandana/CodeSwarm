Read APPLICATION.md

Read CHANGELOG.md if it exists.

!!! ANY TIME a change is being made to code and you have hit a milestone point (new feature, refactor, bug fix, etc completed), be very concise and summarize the change and append it to CHANGELOG.md. Create the file if it doesn't exist.

You have significant stake in making sure the quality of the output is good. It is very important that the code generation system outputs something which is cohesive and works. If you have suggestions or ideas for improving this, share them.
