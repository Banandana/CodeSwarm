# Critical Fixes Applied - Budget Manager and Locking Systems

## Summary
All 6 critical issues in the budget manager and locking systems have been successfully fixed. These fixes address race conditions, resource leaks, and state management problems that could lead to system instability.

## Fixed Issues

### B1: Budget Race Condition (manager.js:93, 131)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
Multiple concurrent calls to `validateOperation()` could race, both reading the same budget state and reserving more than available, leading to budget overruns.

**Solution:**
- Added mutex-based synchronization for atomic validate-and-reserve operations
- Implemented `_acquireMutex()` helper method using promise chaining
- Wrapped entire `validateOperation()` method with mutex acquire/release
- Ensures mutex is always released via finally block, even on errors

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/kitty/Desktop/dev-system/src/core/budget/manager.js`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Added mutex infrastructure
this.operationMutex = Promise.resolve();

// Atomic operation wrapper
async validateOperation(operationId, estimatedCost, agentId, priority = 'MEDIUM') {
  const unlock = await this._acquireMutex();
  try {
    // All validation and reservation logic is now atomic
    // ...
  } finally {
    unlock();  // Always release, even on error
  }
}
```

### B2: Budget Untracked Operations (manager.js:187-206)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
`recordUsage()` silently accepted operations that were never validated, bypassing budget controls and tracking. This allowed uncontrolled spending.

**Solution:**
- Modified `recordUsage()` to reject untracked operations with explicit error
- Forces all operations to go through `validateOperation()` first
- Provides clear error message explaining the requirement

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
async recordUsage(operationId, actualCost) {
  const operation = this.usage.operations.get(operationId);

  // FIX B2: Reject untracked operations
  if (!operation) {
    throw new BudgetError(
      `Cannot record usage for untracked operation: ${operationId}. ` +
      `All operations must be validated via validateOperation() before recording usage.`,
      { operationId, actualCost, reason: 'untracked-operation' }
    );
  }
  // ...
}
```

---

### B3: Reserved Budget Not Released (manager.js:81-176)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
When operations failed after budget validation but before completion, reserved budget was never released, causing budget starvation over time.

**Solution:**
- Added new `releaseReservation(operationId)` method
- Validates operation exists and is in 'reserved' state
- Releases reserved budget back to pool
- Emits 'reservationReleased' event for monitoring
- Should be called in error handlers when operations fail

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
async releaseReservation(operationId) {
  const operation = this.usage.operations.get(operationId);

  if (!operation || operation.status !== 'reserved') {
    throw new BudgetError(...);
  }

  // Release the reserved budget
  this.usage.reserved -= operation.estimatedCost;
  this.usage.operations.delete(operationId);

  this.emit('reservationReleased', { ... });

  return { operationId, releasedAmount: operation.estimatedCost };
}
```

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
try {
  await validateOperation(opId, cost, agentId);
  // Perform operation
  await recordUsage(opId, actualCost);
} catch (error) {
  await releaseReservation(opId);  // Release on failure
  throw error;
}
```

### B4: Circuit Breaker Records Success Too Early (manager.js:154)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
Circuit breaker recorded success immediately after validation, before operation actually completed. This could mark failing operations as successful, defeating the circuit breaker's purpose.

**Solution:**
- Removed `circuitBreaker.recordSuccess()` from `validateOperation()`
- Moved it to `recordUsage()`, after operation completes successfully
- Now circuit breaker only counts truly successful operations

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
async validateOperation(...) {
  // ...
  // FIX B4: Removed recordSuccess() from here
  return { approved: true, ... };
}

async recordUsage(operationId, actualCost) {
  // ... record usage ...

  // FIX B4: Record circuit breaker success AFTER operation completes
  this.circuitBreaker.recordSuccess();

  return { operationId, actualCost, ... };
}
```

---

### B5: Circuit Breaker State Race (circuit-breaker.js:23-82)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
Concurrent calls to `recordSuccess()` and `recordFailure()` could race, causing inconsistent state transitions, incorrect counters, and broken circuit breaker behavior.

**Solution:**
- Added mutex-based state transition serialization
- Implemented `_acquireStateMutex()` helper method
- Made `recordSuccess()` and `recordFailure()` async with mutex protection
- Fixed improper state transition in `canExecute()` (removed side effect)
- All state transitions now properly serialized

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/kitty/Desktop/dev-system/src/core/budget/circuit-breaker.js`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
constructor(options = {}) {
  // ...
  // FIX B5: State transition queue
  this.stateTransitionMutex = Promise.resolve();
}

async recordSuccess() {
  const unlock = await this._acquireStateMutex();
  try {
    // All state transition logic is now atomic
    this.failureCount = 0;

    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      const now = Date.now();
      if (now >= this.nextAttemptTime) {
        this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';
        this.successCount = 1;
      }
    } else if (this.state === 'HALF_OPEN') {
      // ...
    }
  } finally {
    unlock();
  }
}
```

### B6: Lock Leak on Timeout (distributed-lock.js:71-79)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
When lock acquisition timed out, the waiter was removed from queue but could still be granted the lock later if queue processing happened at the same time, leading to duplicate locks and corruption.

**Solution:**
- Added `cancelled` flag to waiter objects
- Implemented `_markAsCancelled()` helper method
- Mark waiter as cancelled BEFORE removing from queue
- Check cancellation status in `_processQueue()` before granting lock
- Skip cancelled waiters and move to next in queue

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/kitty/Desktop/dev-system/src/core/locking/distributed-lock.js`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Track cancellation state
this.lockQueue.get(resourceId).push({
  lockId,
  agentId,
  expiresAt,
  resolve,
  reject,
  cancelled: false  // FIX B6: Track cancellation
});

// Mark as cancelled before removal
if (Date.now() >= expiresAt) {
  this._markAsCancelled(resourceId, lockId);  // Mark first
  this._removeFromQueue(resourceId, lockId);   // Then remove
  // ...
}

// Check cancellation before granting
async _processQueue(resourceId) {
  const waiter = queue.shift();

  // FIX B6: Check if cancelled
  if (waiter.cancelled) {
    await this._processQueue(resourceId);  // Skip to next
    return;
  }

  // Check expiration, then grant if valid
  // ...
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Budget Manager Tests
1. **Concurrent Validation Test (B1):**
   - Spawn multiple concurrent `validateOperation()` calls
   - Verify no budget overruns occur
   - Verify all operations are properly serialized

2. **Untracked Operation Test (B2):**
   - Call `recordUsage()` without prior `validateOperation()`
   - Verify error is thrown with correct message

3. **Reservation Release Test (B3):**
   - Validate operation, then call `releaseReservation()`
   - Verify reserved budget returns to available pool
   - Test error cases (invalid operation, already completed)

4. **Circuit Breaker Timing Test (B4):**
   - Validate operation but let it fail before recording usage
   - Verify circuit breaker counts it as failure, not success

### Circuit Breaker Tests
1. **State Race Test (B5):**
   - Call `recordSuccess()` and `recordFailure()` concurrently many times
   - Verify state transitions are consistent
   - Verify counters are accurate

### Lock Manager Tests
1. **Timeout Race Test (B6):**
   - Start lock acquisition that will timeout
   - Release lock at same moment as timeout
   - Verify lock is never granted to timed-out waiter
   - Verify no duplicate locks occur

## Impact Assessment

### Performance
- **Minimal Impact:** Mutex operations add minimal overhead (async promise chaining)
- **Better Throughput:** Prevents errors and retries, improving overall system performance
- **No Blocking:** All mutexes use async patterns, no thread blocking

### Reliability
- **High Impact:** Eliminates race conditions that could cause budget overruns
- **Resource Safety:** Prevents budget and lock leaks
- **State Consistency:** Ensures circuit breaker operates correctly

### Backward Compatibility
- **Breaking Change (B2):** Code that relied on recording untracked operations will now throw errors
  - **Migration:** Add `validateOperation()` calls before `recordUsage()`
- **Breaking Change (B3):** Must explicitly call `releaseReservation()` on errors
  - **Migration:** Add error handlers that call `releaseReservation()`
- **API Change (B4, B5):** `recordSuccess()` and `recordFailure()` are now async
  - **Migration:** Await these calls if you need to wait for state transition
