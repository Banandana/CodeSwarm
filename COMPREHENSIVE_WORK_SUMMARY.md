## Part 1: Budget Tracking Bug Analysis & Fix

### Problem Discovery

**Issue**: Running a simple "Hello World" test revealed a critical regression where all agent operations were failing with "Cannot record usage for untracked operation" errors.

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - System completely non-functional for code generation

### Root Cause Analysis

**Timeout Mismatch**:
- Budget manager cleanup timeout: **5 seconds**
- Claude API response time: **15-30 seconds typical**
- Result: Operations validated successfully were being deleted before they could complete

**Timeline of Bug**:
```
T+0ms     validateOperation() stores operation with timestamp
T+5000ms  cleanup() runs and deletes operation (age > 5s timeout)
T+15023ms API call completes, recordUsage() called
          Operation not found → "untracked operation" error thrown
```

### Impact Assessment

- **100% failure rate** for all API calls taking longer than 5 seconds
- **Coordinator agent**: ✅ Initial call works (< 5s)
- **Feature coordinators**: ❌ Fails (15-20s calls)
- **Specialist agents**: ❌ Fails (20-30s calls)
- **Production readiness**: Blocked - system cannot function

### Fix Implemented

**Solution**: Increase `stepTimeout` from 5 seconds to 120 seconds (2 minutes)

**File Modified**: `src/core/budget/manager.js` (line 23)

```javascript
// BEFORE:
stepTimeout: config.stepTimeout || 5000,

// AFTER:
stepTimeout: config.stepTimeout || 120000,  // 2 minutes (was 5000ms)
```

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Simplest fix (one line change)
- ✅ Provides 4x safety margin over typical 30s API calls
- ✅ Aligns with ClaudeClient 10-minute timeout
- ✅ Still cleans up truly failed operations
- ✅ Low risk, easy to verify
- ✅ No breaking changes

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** and committed

### Additional Fixes Applied

While investigating the budget bug, several related issues were fixed:

1. **Base Agent - Cost Estimation** (`src/agents/base-agent.js`)
   - Added `_estimateClaudeCost()` method
   - Modified `callClaude()` to include `estimatedCost` in messages

2. **Claude Client - Budget Validation** (`src/api/claude-client.js`)
   - Always creates own UUID for operation tracking
   - Always validates budget before API calls
   - Uses `releaseReservation()` in error handlers (not `recordUsage(0)`)

3. **Communication Hub - Simplified Routing** (`src/core/communication/hub.js`)
   - Removed duplicate budget validation
   - Added comment explaining ClaudeClient handles its own validation

4. **App.js - Simplified Handler** (`src/app.js`)
   - Removed unnecessary operation ID passing

   - Root cause analysis with timeline
   - Complete operation lifecycle trace

  agentId,
  priority,
  currentReserved: this.usage.reserved
});
```

**Log Levels**:
- `console.log()` - Normal operation flow
- `console.warn()` - Unusual but handled situations
- `console.error()` - Errors and failures
- `console.debug()` - Detailed trace information

**Structured Data**:
- All logs use objects for details
- Easy to parse and analyze
- Consistent field naming
- ISO timestamps where relevant

**Coverage**:
- Before/after critical operations
- Entry/exit of important methods
- All state changes
- Error paths with full context
- Duration tracking for long operations
